# ⚔️ Fatal Encounter

Welcome to **Fatal Encounter**, a turn-based battle game where strategy decides victory.  
The player faces off against an enemy, with the choice to **Attack**, **Defend**, or **Heal** each turn.  
The game ends when either the player’s or enemy’s health reaches zero.

🚧 **Note:** Fatal Encounter is still a **Work in Progress (WIP)**. Features, visuals, and gameplay mechanics may change as development continues.

## 📖 About
Fatal Encounter began as a simple terminal-based game in late 2024.  
Originally, players chose between three options—**Attack**, **Defend**, or **Heal**.  

Since then, the project has evolved:
- 🎨 A **Tkinter-based UI** was added for more intuitive gameplay.  
- 🛒 A **Shop & Upgrades system** now allows you to improve your character.  
- 📝 **Patch notes** are displayed directly in the game.
